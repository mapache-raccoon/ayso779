    Frequently Asked Questions
  </h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Do Spring Teams have tryouts?</strong><br />
    Spring players are selected by the Spring coach based on individual talent
    and achievements demonstrated during the Fall Core season.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Can players participate in Spring and Club Soccer?</strong><br />
    Your child may be selected with the expectation that he or she will NOT
    participate in a Club program while playing in the Spring Competitive
    season, because the two programs require such high levels of commitment that
    a player on both a Club and a Spring Competitive team probably cannot
    satisfy his or her obligations to both teams. A player who joins a Club
    after being selected to participate on a Spring Competitive team may lose
    his or her place on the Spring team.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How Many Tournaments do Spring Teams Participate In?</strong><br />
    There is no limit, but most teams play between 5-7 tournaments in Spring
    from January through June.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What is the commitment level for Spring soccer?</strong><br />
    A high level of commitment is expected from the coaches, players, and the
    parents. Other obligations must be disclosed prior to accepting an offer to
    play Spring soccer. Some players are involved in other sports and
    activities, Select/All-Star coaches require that training sessions and games
    take equal precedence with other activities. Parents will be required to
    volunteer at the Region 779 hosted tournament in March.
