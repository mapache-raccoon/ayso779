    >AYSO’s Annual National Player Membership</span
  >
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span style="font-family: Arial"
    >National AYSO requires every player in every region to pay an annual,
    non-refundable, non-transferable national player membership fee (currently
    $25.00), once per membership year (August 1st – July 31st). This membership
    must be renewed annually for each player participating in any AYSO program
    and is separate from Chino Hills Region 779’s program fees. The National
    Player Membership fee is added as a separate line item during the
    registration process and must be collected at the time of registration.
    Payment of the National Annual Player Membership Fee entitles the player to
    a Player ID Card, all AYSO member benefits including being able to be placed
    on a team, insurance coverage and the ability to register for any available
    player program in any AYSO Region, Area or Section for which the player is
    eligible without having to pay the national fee again in the same Membership
    Year. If your player decides to withdraw from the program, this fee cannot
    be refunded, per AYSO National policy.</span

</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial">Transaction Fee</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">
  <span style="font-family: Arial"
    >A non-refundable transaction fee of $2.75 is applied to each transaction
    within the Sports Connect system. This fee is per transaction, not per
    registration. If you have multiple children in one household, you can
    register them and check out in one transaction. This fee is added as a
    separate line item during the registration process and must be collected at
    the time of registration. If your player decides to withdraw from the
    program, this fee cannot be refunded, per AYSO National policy.</span

    >Teams are formed based on age divisions and the number of available
    volunteers. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate requests. We can only
    guarantee the placement of siblings in the same age group on the same team.
    Practice schedule accommodations are only available to parents wishing to
    coach their own child’s team. Coaches will receive team rosters no later
    than July 31st. Please do not expect to be contacted immediately, as the
    coaches may take a week or two to contact their players. If your coach
    hasn't contacted you by August 15th, please contact your division
    coordinator. Division Coordinator contact information is available on the
