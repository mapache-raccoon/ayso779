Program Overview
The AYSO Spring All-Star & Select Travel Program is an exciting opportunity for players in the 10U–19U divisions to take their game to the next level! These teams play in competitive league games and tournaments across Southern California, offering players the chance to sharpen their skills while enjoying the fun, challenge, and camaraderie of soccer.
The program is designed for players who have demonstrated strong soccer ability, a positive attitude, good sportsmanship, and a cooperative team spirit. Practices begin in December with the season running through June/July. No formal tryouts are held—coaches select players directly for Spring All-Star & Select teams.
Participation requires a higher level of commitment from both players and families. Players are expected to attend all practices and games, support their teammates, and represent AYSO with pride. Teams compete against neighboring AYSO regions and enter tournaments, which may involve travel on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
Family Involvement: Spring All-Star & Select teams are financially self-supporting. Families participate in fundraising, and parent involvement is essential. The program builds skills, responsibility, teamwork, and lasting friendships.

Coaches interested in leading a Spring All-Star or Select team must complete a Spring Coach Application using the form below. (Applications are not open at this time.)
Prerequisites for Coaches:
Be a current, registered AYSO volunteer.
Hold the appropriate division coaching certification. (Note: 10U coaches must be 12U certified.)

Submitting an application does not guarantee an interview or selection. All applications are reviewed by the Board Select Committee, with final approval made by the Regional Commissioner. The RC, Select Coordinator, and Executive Board reserve the right to approve or deny coaches.
Important: Coaches may not approach or confirm players for roster spots in any way until they have been officially selected and approved. Doing so is not permitted under AYSO Spring All-Star & Select guidelines.

Player Eligibility
To be considered for invitation, players must meet the following requirements:
10U–14U players: Play at least 70% of the regular fall season games and a minimum of 75% of each game.
16U–19U players: Play at least 50% of the regular fall season games and a minimum of 50% of each game.
Note: AYSO EXTRA and Alliance players are not eligible to participate on a Spring All-Star or Select team as rostered players or guest players. 
The Spring program is intended for players who demonstrate strong soccer skills and show a positive attitude, enthusiasm, fair play, and a cooperative team spirit.

Commitment & Expectations
Participation on a Spring team requires a higher level of commitment from both players and parents. Players are expected to:
Punctually attend all practices and games.
Show responsibility toward coaches and teammates.
Prioritize Spring soccer equally alongside other sports or activities.
Teams may participate in both Spring League (Area play) and tournaments. Tournaments include Sunday play and may require travel.
Most teams play 5–7 tournaments between January and June.
Each team is self-funded. Parents should expect a cost of approximately $600 per player.
Families are expected to support team fundraising efforts, which help offset costs for all players.
All families of players are also required to volunteer at the Region 779-hosted tournament in March.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do Spring Teams have tryouts?
No. Spring players are selected directly by the coach based on their talent and performance during the Fall Core season.
Can players participate in both Spring and Club soccer?
No. Players selected for Spring All-Star or Select are expected not to participate in a Club program during the Spring season. The time commitment for both programs is too demanding, and players who join a Club team after accepting a spot on a Spring team may lose their Spring roster position.
