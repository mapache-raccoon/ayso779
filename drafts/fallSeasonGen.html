            Post Season Invitational Tournament (10U-14U only)
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A post season invitational tournament is held at the conclusion of
              the regular season for the U10 through U14 divisions. The only
              requirement to be eligible for the post season invitational is
              that a team must maintain 25 points.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each team starts off with 30 points. 20 of these points are
              referee points and 10 are team sportsmanship points.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each team will be required to supply an AR for 10 games and a
              Center Referee for approximately 5 games.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each team will provide an AR for their own game to be positioned
              on their sideline.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Home team will be required to provide a Center Referee for the
              game prior to their own.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the instance of the last game of the day the Visiting team of
              the second to last game will provide the Center Referee for the
              Last game of the day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Referees will be assigned to teams. Coaches will submit a referee
              form with a list of their referees similar to that of a Tournament
              Referee Form. Ref Admins will verify eligibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              2 referee points are deducted for each missed center referee
              assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
              1 referee point is deducted for each missed assistant referee
              assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sportsmanship points are deducted for coach ejections or warnings.
              Sideline behavior is key to keeping your points.
            </li>
            <li>
              A team not earning the required referee and sportsmanship points
              will not be invited to participate in the post season invitational
              tournament regardless of the team’s standings at the end of the
              season.
            </li>
            <li>
              The winners of the championship matches in each division will
              automatically advance to the Area 1B Fall Tournament which will be
              held in January.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Referee and Coach Administration will determine who is
              eligible based on points.
